👋 Hi, I'm Nicke!
🚀 I'm passionate about technology and always eager to learn.

🌱 Currently, I'm focused on mastering JavaScript and Angular through a bootcamp.

💼 I'm open to collaboration opportunities in front-end development to gain experience and give back to the community.

🌌 Beyond my tech interests, I have a profound love for the cosmos and its wonders.

🎶 I'm also a music enthusiast, enjoy watching doramas and anime, and have a keen interest in art and culture in general.

🐾 I'm a devoted pet lover and have two adorable companions, Lua and Maju, who are like my children.
