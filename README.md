👋 Hi, I'm @ArtNicke.Dev

👀 I'm interested in front-end development and I'm dedicating time to improve in this field.

🌱 Currently, I'm focused on learning JavaScript and Angular through a bootcamp.

💞️ I'm looking for collaboration opportunities on front-end projects to gain experience and contribute to the community.

🌌 In addition to my love for technology, I have a deep passion for the sky and its sciences.

🎶 I'm also a music enthusiast, enjoy watching doramas and anime, and have a keen interest in art and culture in general.

🐾 I'm a devoted pet lover and have two adorable companions, Lua and Maju, who are like my children.
